An efficient compact, immutable byte string type (both strict and
lazy) suitable for binary or 8-bit character data.

The ByteString type represents sequences of bytes or 8-bit
characters. It is suitable for high performance use, both in terms of
large data quantities, or high speed requirements. The ByteString
functions follow the same style as Haskell's ordinary lists, so it is
easy to convert code from using String to ByteString.
